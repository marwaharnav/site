Through the course of my bachelors, I have tried to branch out and learn about the various fields of work in aerospace as well as mechanical engineering, through my participation in Parikshit, internships, as well as lab projects for my courses. These projects are all listed below. 

The key for the projects are as follows :   - üõ∞Ô∏è -> modules at Parikshit ; üíº -> internships ; üíª -> lab projects

  <summary>üõ∞Ô∏è 2U nanosatellite structure - meeting calypoly specifications and industry standards</summary>
  <div>
    <p>
      To allow for an outsourced battery pack, solar panels, and onboard computer to be placed in the structure,  
      a complete overhaul of the satellite structure was done. In the process, we managed to reduce the weight of  
      the structure by 33% while maintaining satisfactory structural strength to overcome launch loads. The design  
      was made on Fusion360, and the preliminary analysis was done using ANSYS.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The structure shall be able to mate with an industry-standard 2U class deployer</li>
      <li>It shall be capable of surviving launch loads:
        <ul>
          <li>Acceleration loads</li>
          <li>Vibrational loads of the launch vehicle</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The newly designed structure shall allow for outsourced parts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The redesign also led to the reworking of the onboard burn wire mechanisms and the killswitch mechanism.
