#### about me
Hi, I am arnav Marwaha, a fourth-year mechanical engineering student from the Manipal Institute of Technology. At manipal, I have been involved with the [Parikshit Student Satellite](parikshitspace.in) in the capacity of system engineer and the subsystem head of the Structures, Thermals and Mechanisms Subsystem when I was not interning at GE Aerospace or DRDO. 

Currently, I am working on my bachelors project at [BEUMER Group](https://www.beumergroup.com/about-us/beumer-india-private-limited/).

I will soon be starting my masters, where I hope to continue working on aerospace structures and mechanisms, and to dive deeper into spacecraft mission planning and control.

I'd love to hear your thoughts regarding any of the work I have done previously, as well as guidance you can give me for my future endeavours.
